-----------------------------------

2.68.3 (2017-07-07)
  • Updated the User's Guide to look more like a DFO CSAS or Tech Report document using Arial 11pt. (RH 170707)
  • Created header files for `parser.c', `fib.c' and `fib2.c', paralleling NB's changes to PBSmapping. (RH 170707)
  • Added documentation directory in SVN (not in package) to keep track of changes to the User's Guide. (RH 170707)
  • Registered C routines (new CRAN request) using Roger Bivand's maptools `init.c' as a template. (NB/RH 170626)
  • Modified function `viewCode' to use the `00Index.html' file in the user's local package libraries for `output=2' (RH 170626)
	Previously, the function tried to grab this from the local HTTP server 127.0.0.1.
  • Changed backticks ` in DESCRIPTION to single quotes ' (Kurt Hornik 2016-09-20)
  • You need to set the BINPREF variable in etc/.../Makeconf and you can omit the ? (Uwe Ligges 2016-04-18)
	Old: BINPREF ?= c:/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/
	New: BINPREF = C:/Apps/R/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/

2.68.2 (2016-04-04)
  • Updated `DESCRIPTION' file to properly inlcude all contributors. (RH 160404)
  • Modified function `drawBars' to fill the bars with colour when new argument `fill' is set to a colour. (RH 160404)
  • Updated the vignette `PBSmodellingIntro.Rnw'. (RH 160404)

2.68.1 2015-09-04
  • Added imports for undefined globals to the NAMESPACE (new requirement). (RH 150904)
  • Revised the DESCRIPTION file to help CRAN's library system. (RH 150904)
  • Revised function `plotCsum' to work faster on large vectors (length>1e4) by removing duplicates only for plotting. (RH 150901)

2.68.0 2015-08-12
  • Version with format x.y.z in DESCRIPTION
  • Always increase (usually add 1 to z) when committing to Git

2.67 2015-06-15
  • Last update to Google Code before transferring pbs-modelling repository to GitHub. (RH 150615)
  • Fixed logic (hopefully) in function `view' when dealing with list objects. (RH 150610)
  • Fixed calls to httpdPort in `showHelp' and `viewCode' to only work in versions of R >= ver. 3.3.0 (RH 150416)
  • Fixed a broken hyperlink in `CCA.qbr.Rd' and compressed `CCA.qbr.rda' further. (RH 150122)
  • Promoted `XML' package from `Suggests' to `Imports' as `presentTalk' uses quite a few `XML' functions and `require' in package code is dissuaded by CRAN. (RH 150120)
  • Changed function calls using `require' to use `requireNamespace' and functions need `pkg::' prefix (e.g. KernSmooth::bkde2D). (RH 150120)
  • Removed calls to `tools:::httpdPort' and replaced with `tools::startDynamicHelp(NA)' at the request of Kurt Hornik. (150120)
  • Bumped up version for next posting to CRAN using builds under R-3.2.0 (RH 150120)

2.66  2014-03-27
  • JTS requested that RH becomes the package Maintainer. (RH 140327)
  • Wrapped calls to `tools:::httpdPort` with `eval(parse())` in functions `showHelp` and `viewCode`. (RH 140320)
  • Bumped up version for next posting to CRAN using builds under R-3.0.3 (RH 140320)

2.65  2014-03-20
  • Modified function `evalCall` to recognise a user-modified dots list called `dots` (RH 140304)
	Useful for passing selected/modified original dots into various functions within the calling function.
  • Fixed Rcheck NOTE: `Package in Depends field not imported from: 'methods'` by 
	(a) moving `methods` from Depends to Imports in DESCRIPTION file and
	(b) adding `import(methods)` to NAMESPACE file;
	(c) also moved `tcltk` from Depends to Imports in DESCRIPTION file (may or may not matter) (RH 140214)
  • Fixed Rcheck NOTE: `Rd file '.../PBSmodelling/man/openFile.Rd': \examples lines wider than 100 characters` (RH 140214)
  • Modified function `packList` to use accessor functions `tget`, `tcall`, and `tput`; should be much faster. (RH 130716)
  • Updated each example code file to run in `.PBSmodEnv`. (RH 130716)
  • Revised functions `runDemos` and `showVignettes` to avoid deprecated functions in package `tools` (requested by Kurt Hornik). (RH 130702)
  • Removed `PBSddesolve` from `Suggests` in DESCRIPTION file. (RH 130418)
  • Moved obsolete tools from `trunk` root to `oldtools` under `branches`. (RH 130418)
  • Fixed bug in `openFile` - `gsub` needs to expand WinOS "\\" delimiters introduced by `normalizePath`. (RH 130405)
  • Masked two `assign` calls where the user can choose to populate the global environment with objects using functions `getWinVal` and `unpackList`. (RH 130405)
  • Revised the User Guide, `Rcopy.bat`, and `setPBSoptions.Rd`. (RH 130328)
  • Revised the command line tools (e.g., RPaths.bat in directory PBStools). (RH 130327)
  • Corrected the behaviour of `slideplus` widget to match documentation ( issue 83 ). (NB 130219)
  • Corrected the behaviour of `spinbox` widget to match documentation ( issue 83 ). (NB 130218)
  • Moved start-up message to `.onAttach` and test for Tk availability. (NB 130210)
  • Improved warning messages when `tclRequire` fails ( Issue 90 ). (NB 130210)
  • Changed page up/page down button labels to work the same on all systems. (NB 2/9)
  • Allow multiple on-screen windows to have different bg colours (Issues 3 & 84) (NB 130207)
  • Modified function `setOptions` to support a list of options ( issue 81 ). (NB 130126)
  • Fixed a number of spelling mistakes. (NB 130120)
  • Added support to readList/writeList ("P" format) for nested lists. (NB 130120)
  • Addressed  issue 61 : openFile ("..") opened the current directory and not parent. (NB 130113)
  • Fixed a few bugs due to misplaced `.tget(.PBSmod)` statements (thanks Athena Ogden). (RH 130102)
  • Modified function `showVignettes`; old code was based on deprecated grid structure (see Issue 86). (RH 121221)
  • Re-organised some of the R code (no functional changes). (RH 121220)
  • Fixed the problem of widget `label` `name` argument not being recognised (mismatch in `tget` and `tput` calls, not sure where though). (RH 121218)
  • Disabled the grid check in `.validateWindowDescWidgets` because the structure of a windows description list must have changed since this little-used function was written. (RH 121217)
  • Finished updating example section in Rd files. (RH 121217)
  • Filed Issue 86 on GoogleCode: `.validateWindowDescWidgets` appears to be buggy. (RH 121214)
  • Updated runExamples to run in the new environment .PBSmodEnv. (RH 121210)
  • Finally got the gui code to work after switching the location of .PBSmod to .PBSmodEnv. (RH 121207)
  • Bumped up the version as PBSmodelling is undergoing major changes to ensure that no objects are installed on the user's global environment. (RH 121201)

2.64  2012-11-29
  • Updated the UG. (RH 121129)
  • Changed the default environment for 'createWin' from 'parent.frame()' to 'sys.frame(sys.nframe())'. (RH 121129)
	Enclosing super assignment operator '<<-' calls in eval(parse(text="")) expressions (see RH 7/17/12) was disabling the creation of GUIs launched from other GUIs (Athena Ogden).
	This appears to be related to a loss of synchronization of environments between PBSmodelling and tcltk.
  • Added dot functions to namespace for export using explicit action patterns. (RH 121102)
  • Changed JTS's email address to schnutej-dfo@shaw.ca (RH 121102)

  • Implemented Brian Ripley's suggestion to remove NOTES about 'no visible binding for global variable xxx':
	if(getRversion() >= "2.15.1") globalVariables(names=c(...), package="PBSmapping") (RH 120717)
  • Revised function 'TestFuns' to deal with closing windows more consistently. (RH 120327)
  • Revised function 'pad0' to deal with vectors containing mixtures of numeric and character elements. (RH 111212)

  • Updated UG. (RH 111121)
  • Used 'packageStartupMessage' and 'message' rather than 'cat' in '.onLoad' in 'zzz.r'. (RH 111115)
  • Building PDF manuals (for R itself or packages, e.g. via R CMD check) by default requires the LaTeX package inconsolata. (RH 111115)
  • Note: R.2.14.0 now requires all packages to have a namespace; added some dot functions to export. (RH 111109)
  • Revised function 'doAction' to convert underscore period '..' in WDF to four back slashes and one period '\\\\.' in R code. (RH 111108)
  • Revised function 'view' to iteratively 'view' contents of a list object. (RH 111031)
  • Added an example to 'evalCall.Rd'. (RH 110909)
  • Renamed and revised the function 'focusRcon' to 'focusRgui' so that it can set the focus back to RGui from a PBSmodelling window. (RH 110909)
  • Fixed small bug in 'testFuns.r' which called 'testPch' with 'bs=FALSE' (RH 110909)
  • Started new version for eventual posting to CRAN. (RH 110908)

2.63  2011-09-09

  • Added anchor arg for label widgets. (ACB 100122)
  • Refactored parsewinfile to *not* nest grid items - now a single list of widgets is passed to

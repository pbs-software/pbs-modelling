-----------------------------------

2.68.9 (2021-11-23) [Rcheck=T Rbuild=T]
  * Documentation
    + Updated the user guide `PBSmodelling-UG'. (RH 2021-11-23)
    + Changed subdirectory 'PBStools' to 'tools' as the former name conflicts with the package 'PBStools'. (RH 211122)
    + Updated trial package 'PBStry' to conform to more recent requirements for package building. (RH 211122)
  * plotFuns.r
    + Modified function `plotBubbles' to disable code that transformed negative values to positive. (RH 211104)
  * supportFuns.r
    + Updated function `show0' to deal with changing decimal place delimiters. (RH 190703)
      - Decimal delimter is specified in options()$OutDec -- in french, the decimal delimiter is a comma ','.

2.68.8 (2019-03-12) [Rcheck=T Rbuild=T]
  * C code
    + Changed `parser.c' to confine PROTECT statements to each C function. (RH 190312)
      - Previously, an `obj' counter was passed among functions and was impossible to follow.
      - UNPROTECT now features explicit numbers for stack removal.

2.68.7 (2018-08-16) [Rcheck=F Rbuild=F]
  * plotFuns.r
    + Modified function `plotBubbles' to handle scenario `rpro=T cpro=T'. (RH 180814)
      - Now, if both are TRUE, the entire matrix is divided by the sum of the matrix,
      -   which is graphically equivalent to not converting the matrix to proportions.
      - Previously, if both were TRUE, the matrix rows were converted to proportions and 
      -   then the matrix columns were converted to proportions.

2.68.6 (2017-12-13) [Rcheck=T Rbuild=T]
  * Documentation
    + Disabled examples in Rd files that either call `createWin', `getWinXxx', or `setwd'. (RH 171213)
    + Kurt Hornik needs a revised package on CRAN before 2018-01-05 to safely retain PBSmodelling on CRAN. (KH 171212)

2.68.5 (2017-10-26)
  * Documentation
    + Replaced `index.html' with `Links.html' in ../inst/doc because R build replaces the former with its own version. (RH 171027)
    + Changed format of ChangeLog to a standard that can be read by the function `readClog' in pkg `PBStools'. (RH 171026)
    + Added `README.md' (markdown) file to SVN/Git root, primarily for the GitHub repo. (RH 170811)
      - This info file does not show up in the R package PBSmodelling.

2.68.4 (2017-07-12)
  * supportFuns.r
    + Modified functions `runExample' and `runExamples' to fix a bug in R's `list.files' function, which cannot seem to distinguish directories. (RH 170712)

    + Finalized formatting the User's Guide -- numerous small tweaks. (RH 170711)

2.68.3 (2017-07-07)
  * Documentation
    + Updated the User's Guide to look more like a DFO CSAS or Tech Report document using Arial 11pt. (RH 170707)
    + Added documentation directory in SVN (not in package) to keep track of changes to the User's Guide. (RH 170707)
  * C code
    + Created header files for `parser.c', `fib.c' and `fib2.c', paralleling NB's changes to PBSmapping. (RH 170707)
    + Registered C routines (new CRAN request) using Roger Bivand's maptools `init.c' as a template. (NB/RH 170626)
  * supportFuns.r
    + Modified function `viewCode' to use the `00Index.html' file in the user's local package libraries for `output=2' (RH 170626)
      - Previously, the function tried to grab this from the local HTTP server 127.0.0.1.
  * Documentation
    + Changed backticks ` in DESCRIPTION to single quotes ' (Kurt Hornik 2016-09-20)
    + You need to set the BINPREF variable in etc/.../Makeconf and you can omit the ? (Uwe Ligges 2016-04-18)
      - Old: BINPREF ?= c:/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/
      - New: BINPREF = C:/Apps/R/Rtools/mingw_64/bin/

2.68.2 (2016-04-04)
  * Documentation
    + Updated `DESCRIPTION' file to properly inlcude all contributors. (RH 160404)

2.67 2015-06-15
  * Documentation
    + Last update to Google Code before transferring pbs-modelling repository to GitHub. (RH 150615)
  * supportFuns.r
    + Fixed logic (hopefully) in function `view' when dealing with list objects. (RH 150610)
    + Fixed calls to httpdPort in `showHelp' and `viewCode' to only work in versions of R >= ver. 3.3.0 (RH 150416)
  * Documentation
    + Fixed a broken hyperlink in `CCA.qbr.Rd' and compressed `CCA.qbr.rda' further. (RH 150122)
    + Promoted `XML' package from `Suggests' to `Imports' as `presentTalk' uses quite a few `XML' functions and `require' in package code is dissuaded by CRAN. (RH 150120)
    + Changed function calls using `require' to use `requireNamespace' and functions need `pkg::' prefix (e.g. KernSmooth::bkde2D). (RH 150120)
    + Removed calls to `tools:::httpdPort' and replaced with `tools::startDynamicHelp(NA)' at the request of Kurt Hornik. (150120)

2.65  2014-03-20
  * supportFuns.r
    + Modified function `evalCall` to recognise a user-modified dots list called `dots` (RH 140304)
      - Useful for passing selected/modified original dots into various functions within the calling function.
  * Documentation
    + Fixed Rcheck NOTE: `Package in Depends field not imported from: 'methods'` by 
      - (a) moving `methods` from Depends to Imports in DESCRIPTION file and
      - (b) adding `import(methods)` to NAMESPACE file;
      - (c) also moved `tcltk` from Depends to Imports in DESCRIPTION file (may or may not matter) (RH 140214)
    + Fixed Rcheck NOTE: `Rd file '.../PBSmodelling/man/openFile.Rd': \examples lines wider than 100 characters` (RH 140214)
    + Updated each example code file to run in `.PBSmodEnv`. (RH 130716)
  * listFuns.r
    + Modified function `packList` to use accessor functions `tget`, `tcall`, and `tput`; should be much faster. (RH 130716)
  * supportFuns.r
    + Revised functions `runDemos` and `showVignettes` to avoid deprecated functions in package `tools` (requested by Kurt Hornik). (RH 130702)

    + Masked two `assign` calls where the user can choose to populate the global environment with objects using functions `getWinVal` and `unpackList`. (RH 130405)
  * Documentation
    + Revised the User Guide, `Rcopy.bat`, and `setPBSoptions.Rd`. (RH 130328)
    + Revised the command line tools (e.g., RPaths.bat in directory PBStools). (RH 130327)
  * guiFuns.r
    + Corrected the behaviour of `slideplus` widget to match documentation ( issue 83 ). (NB 130219)

    + Addressed  issue 61 : openFile ("..") opened the current directory and not parent. (NB 130113)
    + Fixed a few bugs due to misplaced `.tget(.PBSmod)` statements (thanks Athena Ogden). (RH 130102)
    + Modified function `showVignettes`; old code was based on deprecated grid structure (see Issue 86). (RH 121221)
  * R code
    + Re-organised some of the R code (no functional changes). (RH 121220)
  * guiFuns.r
    + Fixed the problem of widget `label` `name` argument not being recognised (mismatch in `tget` and `tput` calls, not sure where though). (RH 121218)
    + Disabled the grid check in `.validateWindowDescWidgets` because the structure of a windows description list must have changed since this little-used function was written. (RH 121217)
  * Documentation
    + Finished updating example section in Rd files. (RH 121217)
  * guiFuns.r
    + Filed Issue 86 on GoogleCode: `.validateWindowDescWidgets` appears to be buggy. (RH 121214)

  * R code
    + Finally got the gui code to work after switching the location of .PBSmod to .PBSmodEnv. (RH 121207)
  * Documentation

2.64  2012-11-29
  * Documentation
    + Updated the UG. (RH 121129)
  * guiFuns.r
    + Changed the default environment for 'createWin' from 'parent.frame()' to 'sys.frame(sys.nframe())'. (RH 121129)
      - Enclosing super assignment operator '<<-' calls in eval(parse(text="")) expressions (see RH 7/17/12) was disabling the creation of GUIs launched from other GUIs (Athena Ogden).
      - This appears to be related to a loss of synchronization of environments between PBSmodelling and tcltk.
  * Documentation
    + Added dot functions to namespace for export using explicit action patterns. (RH 121102)
    + Changed JTS's email address to schnutej-dfo@shaw.ca (RH 121102)

    + Building PDF manuals (for R itself or packages, e.g. via R CMD check) by default requires the LaTeX package inconsolata. (RH 111115)
    + Note: R.2.14.0 now requires all packages to have a namespace; added some dot functions to export. (RH 111109)
  * guiFuns.r
    + Revised function 'doAction' to convert underscore period '..' in WDF to four back slashes and one period '\\\\.' in R code. (RH 111108)
  * supportFuns.r
    + Revised function 'view' to iteratively 'view' contents of a list object. (RH 111031)

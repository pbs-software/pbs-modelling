Description: Provides software to facilitate the design, testing, and operation
   of computer models. It focuses particularly on tools that make it easy to
   construct and edit a customized graphical user interface ('GUI'). Although our
   simplified 'GUI' language depends heavily on the R interface to the 'Tcl/Tk'
   package, a user does not need to know 'Tcl/Tk'. Examples illustrate models
   built with other R packages, including 'PBSmapping', 'PBSddesolve', and 'BRugs'. 
   A complete user's guide 'PBSmodelling-UG.pdf' shows how to use this package
   effectively.
